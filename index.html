<h2>Mazharul Anwar</h2>
<h3>Technology Leader, Software Architect, and Passionate Advocate for Innovation</h3>
<p>
  I’ve been in the tech industry for over a decade, building software, architecting systems, leading high-performance teams, and guiding startups from idea to success. Through every challenge and project, I’ve learned that adaptability, learning from failures, and nurturing a strong team are what truly drive innovation.
</p>
<p> 
  As the Head of Engineering - Digital at Pickles Auctions, I lead diverse technology and product streams, empowering over 200 technologists. My mission is to cultivate a culture where teams can thrive, solve meaningful problems, and embrace innovation. Whether it’s architecting cloud-native solutions, driving automation, or ensuring our platform meets the needs of our users, I believe in making technology impactful.

  I’m also working on building an Engineering Center of Excellence to uplift technical capabilities, foster collaboration, and set high standards across the organization. I take pride in enabling my teams to deliver outcomes that matter, ensuring that we’re not just building software, but building value.
</p>

<p>
  Previously, I served as Head of Solution Architecture at Petronas, where I played a critical role in shaping and executing the technical vision of large-scale projects like ROVR. These experiences helped me realize the importance of aligning technical strategies with real customer needs, and that’s a lesson I carry forward today in every aspect of my work.

</p>

<p>
  Beyond my roles, I’m passionate about mentoring engineers and helping them grow, both technically and personally. I believe in servant leadership—empowering others and creating opportunities for them to succeed. Whether I’m spending time in a terminal experimenting with new technologies, coaching a team member, or strategizing for the future, I’m driven by curiosity and the impact technology can have when used well.

</p>

<p>
  If you’re interested in connecting, whether to talk tech, explore opportunities, or share thoughts on leadership and innovation, I’m always open to a conversation. Feel free to reach out!
